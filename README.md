## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We're going to build a C code generator by training an RNN on a huge corpus of C code (the linux kernel code). You can download the C code used as source text from the following link:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/kernel

We have already downloaded the entire kernel folder and stored in a local directory.

- What is the background of your project?

In this notebook, we are attempting to generate text using RNN.

- Business Problem Statement:

## Conclusions
- We could generated text using RNN, used LSTM Model and created a function that made predictions for next character based on temperature.
